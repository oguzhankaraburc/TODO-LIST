# TODO List Application

This is a simple TODO list application that allows users to add, remove, and filter tasks. The application stores the tasks in the browser's local storage, making them persistent even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Todo" button to add it to your list.
- **Remove Tasks**: Each task can be removed by clicking the delete icon next to it.
- **Filter Tasks**: Search for specific tasks using the search input.
- **Clear All Tasks**: Remove all tasks at once with the "Clear All Todos" button.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they remain after a page refresh.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap for styling)
- JavaScript (for functionality)
